## Purpose

How can we use publicly available data - from different sources like Stats Canada or the BC provincial government - to support the evaluation of RTVS?

### Goals

Using Community Health Service Area (CHSA) geography, find the distance of each CHSA to the nearest hospital emergency department (ED).
